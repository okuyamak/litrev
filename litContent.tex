						\item[Statistical analysis]
						\item[Significance] Examining the fast fod outlets and diet-related health based on previous finding: fast food outlets were stratified by neighborhood deprivation.

    			        	\begin{itemize}
									\item[$\clubsuit$] People in low SES and living in high deprivided neighborhood tend to have worse diet-related health outcomes.
									\item[$\clubsuit$] In the US, higily deprived areas tend to have more fast food outlets.
									\item[$\clubsuit$] In the US, fast food outlets are associated with obesity, but it is mixed in other regions.
									\item[$\clubsuit$] High levels of residential segregation can be a reason that neighobrhoods in the US may influence individual-level health outcomes to a greater extent.  
									\item[$\clubsuit$] Targeted consumers in specific geographical localities, differences in land use planning strategies, and variations in resident's abilities to influence political decision making are caused by residential segregation.
									\item[$\clubsuit$] Future studies should include both health and unhealthy food outlets.

    \item {\bf Barrientos (2017)  -- 45-84 years old -- Prospective cohort}
		\begin{description}
			\item[Setting] 6 US urban areas
			\item[Outcome] BMI
			\item[Exposure] Perceptive: Healthy food availability, walkablle environment. -- survey was conducted to different sample and aggregated for 1 mile and used as proxy for this study samples. Objective: Density of supaermarkets and fruit-and-vegetable markets, recreational resouces within 1 mile form each participant.
			\item[Confounders] Time-invariant: age, sex, race, education, duration of residence. Time-varying: marital status, income, cancer diagnosis -- missing information was inputed from the closest year's examination.  
			\item[Statistical analysis] Within-person change for environment vs within-persion change in BMI was estimated by fixed-effects models. Model 1 included each measure separately -- food and physical activity (perceptive and objective), Model 2 included  percetive and objective simultaneously by food and physical activity, Model 3 included all at once, Model 4 included z-score aggregated by food and physical activity simultaneously. In regression, neighborhood measures were transformed into sd. Sensitivity analysis was made for non-movers during the study period.
    			\item[Significance] First longitudinal study accounting for changes in envrionments in both perceptive and objective measures again changes in BMI. 
    			\item[Conclusion] Favorable changes in both food and physical activity environment  was associated with BMI reductions in obese and overweight persons.
    			\item[Takeaways] \mbox{}\par
    				\begin{itemize}
    					\item[$\clubsuit$] In recent years, neighborhood study moved from a general framework to identifying the specific mechanism -- which neighborhood influence health.
    					\item[$\clubsuit$] Yet longitudinal evidences are still scarce.
    					\item[$\clubsuit$] The few studies investigated whether changes in food availability are related to changes in diet and BMI. Few studies for physical activity environment -- only 1 study found that improve of recreational facilities access was associated with decrease in BMI.

	\item {\bf Mason (2018) -- 40-69 years old -- Cross sectional study}
		\begin{description}
			\item[Setting] 22 UK Biobank assessment centers
			\item[Outcome] Waist circumference, BMI and body fat percentage (BIA) -- centred around the mean  	
			\item[Exposure] Physical activity facilities density within 1000m. Distance to the nearest fastfood outlets categorized as 500, 500-999, 1000-1999, 2000m.
			\item[Confounders] Age, sex, ethnicity, education, income, employment, deprivation, urbanicity, residential density.
			\item[Statistical analysis] Multilevel multiple linear regression with random intercepts and coefficients, accounting for the nesting of individuals within assessment centers. -- final model controled for all covariates and non-exposure environment.
			\item[Significance] Large national dataset which 
			made it possible for sensitivity analysis to strengthen the robustness. Most previous studies focused on particular areas. Comprehensive confounding information from reliable dataset. Focused on commercial physical activity facilities as they are modifiable via regulatory.
    			\item[Conclusion] Physical activity facilities density was associated with lower adiposity. Fast food outlets proximity was also associated with lower adiposity. The association remained the same after stratified by sex, and income groups.
					\item[Takeaways] \mbox{}\par
    				\begin{itemize}
    					\item[$\clubsuit$] Many research on access to fast-food outlets and obesity in the US, yet relatively little research on formal facilities for recreational physical activity.
    					\item[$\clubsuit$] Many research on walkability which focus more on urban designs than receattional facilities.
    					\item[$\clubsuit$] As food and physical activity environments are associated with one another, they are likely to confound the association with adiposity each other -- they should be included as one of the confounders.

	\item{\bf Hirsch (2014) -- 45-84 years old -- Prospective cohort} 
		\begin{description}
			\item[Setting] 6 US urban cities
			\item[Outcome] Self report walking time for recreation and transportation.
			\item[Exposure] Population density, retail area, residential area, social destinations, walking destinations within 1 mile from each resident, distance to bus stops, and street network ratio.
			\item[Confounders] Time-invariate: age, sex, race, and education. Time-varying: income, employment, marital status, car ownership, self-rated health, and arthritis. 
			\item[Statistical analysis] Linear mixed models to estimate the associations of changes in the built environment and changes in walking (transportatin and recreation). Built environment measures were separetely included in the models to avoid multicolinearlity.
			\item[Significance] First study examined the time-varying GIS-based built environment measures and changes in walking.
			\item[Conclusion] Higher residential use and distance to busses were associated with a slightly increase in walking. Incrases in te number of social destinations, walking destinations, and street connectivity were associated with greater increases in wallking for transportation. Higher baseline levels of retail and walking destinations were associated with grater increases in leasure walking, but no changes in built environment measures were associated with leisure walking.
			\item[Takeaways] \mbox{}\par
				\begin{itemize}
					\item[$\clubsuit$] Samples completed at least 2 examinations including baseline, complete information on walking outcomes or built environment at examinations were included.
					\item[$\clubsuit$] Several movers vs non-movers studies found that residential relocation to more walkable environment resulted in increases in physical activity -- yet, these might contain unobservable preferences related to both choice of residential location and behavior.
					\item[$\clubsuit$] Future studies should aim to identify what types of changes are necessary to increase physical activity levels -- potential thresholds

			\item[Conclusion] Implementing environment and political level interventions is difficult due to lack of conceptual models and difficulties of evaluation. Further research is needed, and multiple sectors should collaborate more. 
			\item[Takeaways] \mbox{}\par
				\begin{itemize}
					\item[$\clubsuit$] As of late 1900s, environmental and policy interventions were infrequently applied for the control of chronic diseases. 
					\item[$\clubsuit$] Ecological and social-ecological models of human behavior have evolved in the fields of sociology, psychology, education, and public health. 
					\item[$\clubsuit$] The concept of ecological model which describes the levels of influence on behaviors are developed by McLeroy.

			\item[Outcome] Prevalence of obesity (Overweight:25-30, Obesity:>=30) 
			\item[Exposure] NA 
			\item[Confounders] NA 
			\item[Statistical analysis] Mixed effects linear regression to correct for bias in self-reports. Spatiotemploral Gaussian process regression model to estimate prevalence with 95 percent uncertainty intervals. 
			\item[Significance] Up-to-date information for global obesity trends. It will be important for decision making on what action is needed and where progress is. 
			\item[Conclusion] Especially in low-income and middle-income countries, urgent intervention is needed to modify obesogenic environment. 
			\item[Takeaways] \mbox{}\par
				\begin{itemize}
					\item[$\clubsuit$] Although health risk of obesity is established and obesity prevalence has been increasing worldwide, no national sucess stories have been reported in the past 33 years. 
					\item[$\clubsuit$] The rising prevalence of overweight and obesity in several countries has been described as a global pandemic.  
					\item[$\clubsuit$] In 2010, overweight and obesity were estimated to cause 3-4 million deaths, 4 perent years of life lost, and 4 percent of disability-adjusted life-years worldwide. 
					\item[$\clubsuit$] Prevalence of obesity and overweight has incraesed substantially in the past 30 years. The pattern of increase differ by regions, and it has been attenuated in developed countries in the past 8 years.
					\item[$\clubsuit$] The increase of obesity prevalence can be explained by changes in energy intake such as high fat and calorie diet, decrease in energy expenditure such as decrease in physical activity, and chages in the gut microbiome.
					\item[$\clubsuit$] Most deaths atributable to overweight and obesity are cardiovascular deaths. Only 31 percent of he coronary heart disease risk and 8 percent of the stroke mortality risk associated with obesity is mediated through raised blood pressure and cholesterol.

			\item[Exposure] Fastfood restaurants, bars/pubs, physical activity facilities, healthcare facilities by neighborhood count, individual buffer count, and distance. 
			\item[Confounders] Age, income, neighborhood deprivation index. 
			\item[Statistical analysis] Multilevel logistic regression for incidence propotions of CHD as an outcome. Model 1. CHD vs ne, Model 2. CHD vs ne + nedep, Model 3. CHD vs ne + nedep + age + income.  
			\item[Significance] First study conducted multilevel investigation to examine the longitudinal individual-level association between CHD and neighborhood availability of potentially health-promoting and health-damaging goods. 
			\item[Conclusion] 
			\item[Takeaways] \mbox{}\par
				\begin{itemize}
					\item[$\clubsuit$] Several studies found that neighborhood SES affecs cardiovascular health over individual-level SES.
					\item[$\clubsuit$] Living in deprived neighborhood tend to have limited access to healthy food resources, and it would lead to increase the risk of CHD. However, no clear pattern was found between the availability of different types of resources and level of neighborood deprivation. 
					\item[$\clubsuit$] There was a week association between neighborhood availability between CHD. There was an unexpected direction association between physical activity and healthcare facilities and CHD. 
					\item[$\clubsuit$] The association between neighborhood deprivation and CHD are well established, but the causal pathway is largely unknown. This study aimed to identify whether neighborhood health-damageing/promoting facililites lie in the causal pathway. The findings did not give expected results. Neighborhood deprivation is equal to neighborhood SES? Is the assocaition between neighborhood deprivation/ses and obesity also established?

			\item[Setting] Sweden - Stockholm 
			\item[Outcome] Clinically diagnosed type 2 diabetes.
			\item[Exposure] Neighborhood walkability index.  
			\item[Confounders] Age, gender, income, education, NDI. 
			\item[Statistical analysis] Multilevel logistic regression with individuals nested within their neighborhood. 
			\item[Significance] This was one of the few studies examine the objectively measured walkability and health oucome, i.e., incidence of diabetes in a large cohort. 
			\item[Conclusion] There was a siginficant association between walkable enviornment and incidence of type 2 diabetes after adjusting for neighborhood deprivation. However the association did not remain after further adjusting for individual socio-demographic characteristics. Future research should consider other potential risk factors for diabetes, such as traffic noise or air pollution which may come along with walkable environment. 
			\item[Takeaways] \mbox{}\par
				\begin{itemize}
					\item[$\clubsuit$] There is a need to examine whether individual and neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics may modify the association between the built environment and health related behaviors (Lovasi 2009). Because socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals may be less likely to benefit out from neighborhood envrionment. 
					\item[$\clubsuit$] No significant interaction was found between walkability and individual SES, or walkability and neighborhood deprivation.
					\item[$\clubsuit$] Several studies found association between walkability and physical activity after adjusting for individal and neighborhood socio-demographic factors (Sundquist 2011).

			\item[Statistical analysis] Multilevel linear regression with individuals at the first level and neighborhoods at the second level. Model 1: PA vs walkbility. Model 2: PA vs walkability + individal characteristics + neiborhood income. 
			\item[Significance] First study in Sweden to examine objectively measured PA and obejectively measure walkability.  
			\item[Conclusion] There is a significant association between walkability and physical activity in Swedish adults. 
			\item[Takeaways] \mbox{}\par
				\begin{itemize}
					\item[$\clubsuit$] Interaction between walkability and neighborhood level SES wre not found.
					\item[$\clubsuit$] Australia had a significant interaction between SES and walkability (Leslie, 2007), while no interaction was found in Sweden and Belgium. It might be because of low SES inequalities in these countries.

			\item[Significance] Identify several cost-effective policies that gonvernment priotize for obesity prevention. 
			\item[Conclusion] A rapid increse of efforts for cost-effectiveness analysies of programmes and polices for obesity prevention is needed. 
			\item[Takeaways] \mbox{}\par
				\begin{itemize}
					\item[$\clubsuit$] Important causes for obesity is identified, which is a result of changes in the global food system - the movement from individual to mas preparation, producing more highly processed food.   
					\item[$\clubsuit$] Other factors: national wealth, government policy, cultural norms, built environment, genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, biological bases for food preferences, biological mechanisms that regulate motivation for physical activity amplify or attenumate the effect of thoes causes (nutrition change), and all infulence growth of the epidemic. 
					\item[$\clubsuit$] Most countries do not have enough monitoring data for population physical activity and diet pattern, and obesity prevalence, and it stands as barrier to set an appropriate goal and also assess progress. 
					\item[$\clubsuit$] Obesity could yeild in not only lowering future life expectancy but also increasing short-term and long-term healthcare spendings.
					\item[$\clubsuit$] Body weight response to a change of energy balance is slow. A small but chronic daily energy imbalance gap has caused the continuing weight gain seen in most countries.
					\item[$\clubsuit$] Population intervention for obesity should have effect on equity, acceptability to stakeholders, feasibility of implementation, affordability and sustainability to put policy decision forward. 
					\item[$\clubsuit$] Goverment is the main actor for obesity prevention.Obesity mainly burdens the health system, but various sectors, i.e. finance, eudcation, agriculture, transportation and urban planning have the greatest impact on creating environment conducive to prevention.

			\item[Exposure] Spatial measure of neighborhood level racial/ethnic residential segregation
			\item[Confounders] Time-invariant: age, sex, nativity, education, duration of residence, language. Time-varying: working, marital status, income, smoking, cancer diagnosis, years since baseline.
			\item[Statistical analysis] Stratified analysis by race. Each specific segregation level was used for each race group.
			\item[Significance] Longitudinal analysis for racial/ethnic segregation and BMI. Examining further if segregation impact BMI independent of neighborhood poverty. This is important because neighborhood poverty is neighborhood deprivation - lack of healthy food outlets, physical activity facilities are often be a risk of obeisty, and understanding whether neighborhood poverty is a strong mediator? is critical for designing effective health policy interventions.
			\item[Conclusion] Neighborhood segregation is associated with both higher and lower BMI by race and certain circumstances.
			\item[Takeaways] \mbox{}\par
				\begin{itemize}
					\item[$\clubsuit$] Ratial residential segregation is consistently associated with poor health condition and high mortality.
					\item[$\clubsuit$] Black segregation is associated with incresed mortality risk and adverse birth outcome, while Hispanic segregation is associated with stronger social cohesion, and protective against dicrimination and adoption of harmful behaviors.
					\item[$\clubsuit$] Higher segregation was negatively associated with BMI for white females and positively associated for Hispanic females in cross-secitonal analysis. In longitudinal analysis, higher segregation was positively associated with BMI for black females, but negatively associated for Hispanic females and males.

			\item[Significance] First study to assess the causal path of modifiable neighborhood determinants to obesity.
			\item[Conclusion] Neighborhood disorders (e.g. crime, pilicing) and high street facilities were singnificantly associated with obesity. 
			\item[Takeaways] 
				\begin{itemize}\mbox{}\par
					\item[$\clubsuit$] Neighborhood deprivation is related to morbidity, although relationship is weaker and smaller in magnitude than the relationships between individual SES and morbidity.
					\item[$\clubsuit$] It is important to unpack the "black box" on why, what kind of modifiable factors lie in the causal path.

			\item[Conclusion] Urban sprawl and land use mix were found to be associated with weight status only in North America. 
			\item[Takeaways] 
				\begin{itemize}\mbox{}\par
					\item[$\clubsuit$] Genetic factors underlie the propensity of individuals to become obese, but the rapid growth of obesity is hypothesized to be attributed from social and environmental causes.

			\item[Conclusion] In developed societies, women with lower SES had higher obesity prevalence. In developing societies, men, women and children with higher SES had higher obesity prevalence.
			\item[Takeaways] 
				\begin{itemize}\mbox{}\par
					\item[$\clubsuit$] Enviroments are recognized as possible factors on obesity since Price 1987, and Stunkard 1986.
					\item[$\clubsuit$] The possiblity that SES might be related to body weight was first raised by Veblen 1889, in his speculation that thinness became an ideal of feminine beauty in chivalric times
					\item[$\clubsuit$] Energy balance is established mechanism of obesity Grarrow 1978.
					\item[$\clubsuit$] Energy intake - solely from food consumption. Energy output - basal metabolism, physical activity, thermic effect of food.
					\item[$\clubsuit$] Low prevalence of obesity among low SES group in devloping countries might be due to lack of food or even to famine, coupled with high energy expenditure 
					\item[$\clubsuit$] High prevalence of obesity among high SES group in developng countries might be due to affordability to obtain adequte food, or cultural preference to fat body shapes. Obesity might be a sign of health and wealth in devloping countries, which is opposit from developed countries.
					\item[$\clubsuit$] The higher propensty to become obesity can be often observed among people who are from countries experienced significant food shortage. Their body were biologically mutated to store fat to survive.   
					\item[$\clubsuit$] There is a huge difference between male and female how they percieve obesity as negative or stigmatized image in developed countries.

			\item[Confounders] 
				Basic, education
			\item[Statistical analysis] 
				Hierarchial logistic regresion was used. The individual factors were treated as fixed effects. The CNI and interactions with the CNI were treated as random effects.
			\item[Significance] 
				First study investigated the effect of neighborhood environment on risk factors of CVD with nation-wide random samples after controlling for individual SES. 
			\item[Conclusion] 
				After adjusting for individual age, sex, and SES, people living in deprived neighborhood had a higher risk of obesity, smoking, and physical inactivity.
			\item[Takeaways] \mbox{}\par
				\begin{itemize}
					\item[$\clubsuit$] The SALLS is based on face-to-face interviews that generally took place in the respondents' homes.
					\item[$\clubsuit$] SALLS matched with social status of the respondents' residental areas measured as the CNI and the Townsend score was used.

		\begin{description}
			\item[Objectives]
				To examine whether neighborhood deprivation is independently associated with CVD risk factors, such as smoking, physical inactiviy, obesity, diabetes, and hypertension for Swedish population. 
			\item[Setting] 
				Sweden 
			\item[Outcome]
				Smoking, physical inactivity, obesity, diabetes, hypertension (self reported)
			\item[Exposure] 
				SES composite index by education, occupation, parents' occupation. Deprivation index by elderly living alone, foreign born, residents who moved, unemployed, single parents, low education status, chidlren under age 5.
			\item[Confounders] 
				Age, gender, marital status, immigration status, urbanization, and a composite measure of SES
			\item[Statistical analysis] 
				Hierarchial logistic regresion was used. The individual factors were treated as fixed effects. The CNI and interactions with the CNI were treated as random effects.
			\item[Significance] 
				Builded the previous study by using more recent data (1996-2000), additonal CVD risk factors, and a more comprehensive measure of individual SES 
			\item[Conclusion] 
				After adjusting for individual age, sex, and SES, people living in deprived neighborhood had a higher risk of obesity, smoking, and physical inactivity.
			\item[Takeaways] \mbox{}\par
				\begin{itemize}
					\item[$\clubsuit$] The associations between neighborhood deprivation and CVD has been found by numerous studies. Afterwards, the associations between neighborhood deprivation and CVD risk factors such as smoking, physical inactivity, obesiy, etc has been found after controlling for a range of individual SES.
					\item[$\clubsuit$] Previous research has shown that labor immigrants from Finland, the largenst immigrant group in Sweden most of whome immigrated for work have poorer health than other labor immigrants who have settled in Sweden.

\begin{itemize}
	\item{\bf Lofors(2006) -- 25-64 years -- Cross-sectional study -- Euro J Pub Health} 
		\begin{description}
			\item[Objectives]
				To examine an association between neighborhood income and anxiety after adjusting for individual demographic, socio-economic and social characteristics.
			\item[Setting and subjects] 
				Sweden. National randome sample of the entire Swedish population: 15659 women and 15225 men.
			\item[Outcome]
				Self-reported anxiety. "Do you suffer from nervousness, uneasiness, or anxiety? 1. Yes, severe problems, 2. Yes, slight problems, 3. No."
			\item[Exposure] 
				Proportions of people with the lowest national income quartile at SAMS, and it was divided into quartiles (Q1=least proportion of people with low income, Q4=highest proportion of people with low income). The income variable was based on annual disposable family income and the number of people in the family was adjusted. Also weighted small chidren as they give lower consumption. Source data was from December 1997 women and men aged 25-64. Total of 7094 SAMS were included for this study population. The home addresses were geocoded previously. 239 subjects who were not linked to SAMS were categorized in the neighborhood with the highest income in order to avoid an overestimation of RR.
			\item[Confounders] 
				Age (10y category), gender, marital status, immigrant status, social networks (1. having at least one close friend, 2. meeting friends and other acquantances, 3. exchanging favours with neighbors, 4. casual interaction with neighbors, 5. parents alive), housing tenure, employment, income.
			\item[Statistical analysis] 
				A log binomial model to estimatee prevalence ratios. Stepwise inclusion of individual variables with 4 models.
			\item[Findings] There was an significant gradient association between neighborhood income and prevalence of anxiety when only adjusting for age and gender. However, the association dissapeared when other confounders were included.
			\item[Strengths] 8 individual potential confounders collected by well-trained interviewers, which means that they are adequately measured and lower the risk of residual confoundings. Large randome sample. Neighborhood income was based on entire Swedish population but not the study population.
			\item[Limitations] Non respondents (20\%) might have caused response bias. Anxiety is self-reported. Multilevel modeling was not possible as the number of individuals per SAMS was too samll to allow a correct calculation of the variance measure.
			\item[Significance] 
				The study examined the contextual effect of neighborhood income on anxiety, which is a most common mental disorders among working age group by using national level random samples with control of individual (compositional) effects.
			\item[Conclusion] 
				The contextual effect of neighborhood income disappeared after controling for individual (compositional) effects.
			\item[Takeaways] \mbox{}\par
				\begin{itemize}
					\item[$\clubsuit$] Anxiety tends to be chronic, and can be as disabling as somatic disorders. In addition, individuals with anxiety place a high strain upon the whole healthcare system.
					\item[$\clubsuit$] SALLS has been conducted by Statistics Sweden since 1975 and consists of interviews performed at home by trained interviewers.
					\item[$\clubsuit$] SALLS consists of 11 areas of investigation including demographic and socio-economic characteristics, health status and social environment.

\subsection{BMI and mortality}
	\item{\bf Winter(2014) -- $\geq$65 years -- Meta-analysis -- Am J Clin Nutr} 
		\begin{description}
			\item[Objectives]
				To examine the association betweeen BMI and all-cause mortality among older adults.
			\item[Search database] 
				MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library 1990-2013 for research articles. MEDLINE 2010-2013 for review articles. Studies from Europe, North America, and Australia.
			\item[Search terms]
				body mass index OR BMI OR weight AND mortality AND old* OR geriatr* OR senior for research articles. body mass index OR obesity ND mortality NOT institute* OR hospital* OR nursing home for review articles.
			\item[Inclusion and Exclusion] 
				Inclusion: prospective cohort AND $\geq$65 years AND reported RRs or HRs AND minimum follow-up period $\geq$5 years, baseline BMI and smoking status. Exclusion: HRs reported only for weight in kg OR reported $\le$3 categories of BMI OR wholly nonwhite populations.
			\item[Statistical analysis] 
				A 2-stage random-effects meta-analysis for a potential nonlinear relation between BMI and all-case mortality.
			\item[Significance] 
				While most studies focus on overweight or obese among older adults, this study identified an increased risk of mortality among those with BMI $\le$23.0 which is in the range of healthy weight status by the WHO definition. In addition, this findings were confirmed by subgroup analysis by smoking status, which implies that lower BMI was independently associated with mortality regardless preexisting potential risk factors.
			\item[Conclusion] 
				Signifcant increase of mortality risk was observed from BMI $\le$23.0. 
			\item[Takeaways] \mbox{}\par
				\begin{itemize}
					\item[$\clubsuit$] The WHO defines a healthy body weight range for adddults as a BMI between 18.5~24.9, but those are based on younger adults.
					\item[$\clubsuit$] Weight change ay be more important for older adults in terms of health risks.
