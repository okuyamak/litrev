						\item[Takeaways] \mbox{}\par
							\begin{itemize}
								\item[$\clubsuit$] People in low SES and living in high deprivided neighborhood tend to have worse diet-related health outcomes.
								\item[$\clubsuit$] In the US, higily deprived areas tend to have more fast food outlets.
								\item[$\clubsuit$] In the US, fast food outlets are associated with obesity, but it is mixed in other regions.
								\item[$\clubsuit$] High levels of residential segregation can be a reason that neighobrhoods in the US may influence individual-level health outcomes to a greater extent.  
								\item[$\clubsuit$] Targeted consumers in specific geographical localities, differences in land use planning strategies, and variations in resident's abilities to influence political decision making are caused by residential segregation.
								\item[$\clubsuit$] Future studies should include both health and unhealthy food outlets.

    					\item[$\clubsuit$] Yet longitudinal evidences are still scarce.
    					\item[$\clubsuit$] The few studies investigated whether changes in food availability are related to changes in diet and BMI. Few studies for physical activity environment -- only 1 study found that improve of recreational facilities access was associated with decrease in BMI.

						\begin{itemize}
							\item Physical activity facilities density was associated with lower adiposity. 
							\item Fast food outlets proximity was also associated with lower adiposity. 
							\item The association remained the same after stratified by sex, and income groups.
						\end{itemize}
					\item[Takeaways] \mbox{}\par
    				\begin{itemize}
    					\item[$\clubsuit$] Many research on access to fast-food outlets and obesity in the US, yet relatively little research on formal facilities for recreational physical activity.
    					\item[$\clubsuit$] Many research on walkability which focus more on urban designs than receattional facilities.
    					\item[$\clubsuit$] As food and physical activity environments are associated with one another, they are likely to confound the association with adiposity each other -- they should be included as one of the confounders.

			\item[Conclusion] \mbox{}\par
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Higher residential use and distance to busses were associated with a slightly increase in walking. 
					\item Incrases in te number of social destinations, walking destinations, and street connectivity were associated with greater increases in wallking for transportation. 
					\item Higher baseline levels of retail and walking destinations were associated with grater increases in leasure walking, but no changes in built environment measures were associated with leisure walking.
				\end{itemize}
			\item[Takeaways] \mbox{}\par
				\begin{itemize}
					\item[$\clubsuit$] Samples completed at least 2 examinations including baseline, complete information on walking outcomes or built environment at examinations were included.
					\item[$\clubsuit$] Several movers vs non-movers studies found that residential relocation to more walkable environment resulted in increases in physical activity -- yet, these might contain unobservable preferences related to both choice of residential location and behavior.
					\item[$\clubsuit$] Future studies should aim to identify what types of changes are necessary to increase physical activity levels -- potential thresholds

			\item[Statistical analysis] Mixed effects linear regression to correct for bias in self-reports. Spatiotemploral Gaussian process regression model to estimate prevalence with 95 percent uncertainty intervals. 
			\item[Significance] Up-to-date information for global obesity trends. It will be important for decision making on what action is needed and where progress is. 
			\item[Conclusion] Especially in low-income and middle-income countries, urgent intervention is needed to modify obesogenic environment. 
			\item[Takeaways] \mbox{}\par
				\begin{itemize}
					\item[$\clubsuit$] Although health risk of obesity is established and obesity prevalence has been increasing worldwide, no national sucess stories have been reported in the past 33 years. 
					\item[$\clubsuit$] The rising prevalence of overweight and obesity in several countries has been described as a global pandemic.  
					\item[$\clubsuit$] In 2010, overweight and obesity were estimated to cause 3-4 million deaths, 4 perent years of life lost, and 4 percent of disability-adjusted life-years worldwide. 
					\item[$\clubsuit$] Prevalence of obesity and overweight has incraesed substantially in the past 30 years. The pattern of increase differ by regions, and it has been attenuated in developed countries in the past 8 years.
					\item[$\clubsuit$] The increase of obesity prevalence can be explained by changes in energy intake such as high fat and calorie diet, decrease in energy expenditure such as decrease in physical activity, and chages in the gut microbiome.
					\item[$\clubsuit$] Most deaths atributable to overweight and obesity are cardiovascular deaths. Only 31 percent of he coronary heart disease risk and 8 percent of the stroke mortality risk associated with obesity is mediated through raised blood pressure and cholesterol.

				\begin{itemize}
					\item New Zealand
				\end{itemize}
			\item[Takeaways] \mbox{}\par
				\begin{itemize}
					\item[$\clubsuit$] Several studies found that neighborhood SES affecs cardiovascular health over individual-level SES.
					\item[$\clubsuit$] Living in deprived neighborhood tend to have limited access to healthy food resources, and it would lead to increase the risk of CHD. However, no clear pattern was found between the availability of different types of resources and level of neighborood deprivation. 
					\item[$\clubsuit$] There was a week association between neighborhood availability between CHD. There was an unexpected direction association between physical activity and healthcare facilities and CHD. 
					\item[$\clubsuit$] The association between neighborhood deprivation and CHD are well established, but the causal pathway is largely unknown. This study aimed to identify whether neighborhood health-damageing/promoting facililites lie in the causal pathway. The findings did not give expected results. Neighborhood deprivation is equal to neighborhood SES? Is the assocaition between neighborhood deprivation/ses and obesity also established?

			\item[Conclusion] A rapid increse of efforts for cost-effectiveness analysies of programmes and polices for obesity prevention is needed. 
			\item[Takeaways] \mbox{}\par
				\begin{itemize}
					\item[$\clubsuit$] Important causes for obesity is identified, which is a result of changes in the global food system - the movement from individual to mas preparation, producing more highly processed food.   
					\item[$\clubsuit$] Other factors: national wealth, government policy, cultural norms, built environment, genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, biological bases for food preferences, biological mechanisms that regulate motivation for physical activity amplify or attenumate the effect of thoes causes (nutrition change), and all infulence growth of the epidemic. 
					\item[$\clubsuit$] Most countries do not have enough monitoring data for population physical activity and diet pattern, and obesity prevalence, and it stands as barrier to set an appropriate goal and also assess progress. 
					\item[$\clubsuit$] Obesity could yeild in not only lowering future life expectancy but also increasing short-term and long-term healthcare spendings.
					\item[$\clubsuit$] Body weight response to a change of energy balance is slow. A small but chronic daily energy imbalance gap has caused the continuing weight gain seen in most countries.
					\item[$\clubsuit$] Population intervention for obesity should have effect on equity, acceptability to stakeholders, feasibility of implementation, affordability and sustainability to put policy decision forward. 
					\item[$\clubsuit$] Goverment is the main actor for obesity prevention.Obesity mainly burdens the health system, but various sectors, i.e. finance, eudcation, agriculture, transportation and urban planning have the greatest impact on creating environment conducive to prevention.

					\item[$\clubsuit$] Energy balance is established mechanism of obesity Grarrow 1978.
					\item[$\clubsuit$] Energy intake - solely from food consumption. Energy output - basal metabolism, physical activity, thermic effect of food.
					\item[$\clubsuit$] Low prevalence of obesity among low SES group in devloping countries might be due to lack of food or even to famine, coupled with high energy expenditure 
					\item[$\clubsuit$] High prevalence of obesity among high SES group in developng countries might be due to affordability to obtain adequte food, or cultural preference to fat body shapes. Obesity might be a sign of health and wealth in devloping countries, which is opposit from developed countries.
					\item[$\clubsuit$] The higher propensty to become obesity can be often observed among people who are from countries experienced significant food shortage. Their body were biologically mutated to store fat to survive.

			\item[Setting and subjects]\mbox{}\par 
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Sweden. 
					\item Data from 2 time points: 1980-1981, 1988-1989.
					\item 3843 adults 25-74 years from the same random sample.
				\end{itemize}
			\item[Outcome]\mbox{}\par
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Self-report health status. 0. good vs. 1. poor or anywhere between good and poor.
					\item Original question was dichotomized. How would you describe your general health? 1. good. 2. poor. 3. poor or anywhere between good and poor.
					\item All-cause mortality. Person-year at risk were calculated from the date of the second interview until death or, for those who survived, until 31 Dec 1995.
				\end{itemize}
			\item[Exposure] \mbox{}\par
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Physical activity. 0. regular physical  activity at least once a week. 1. being physically inactive or occasiionally active. 
					\item Smoking. 0. Never smoked. 1. Former smoker. 2. Daily smoker, 1-14 g/day. 3. Daily smoker, $\ge$14 g/day.
					\item BMI

				\end{itemize}
			\item[Statistical analysis]\mbox{}\par 
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Age-standardized prevalences of poor health status by each variable by year.
					\item GEE for poor health vs all variables cross-sectionally.
					\item For GEE, the regression and within-subject correlations are modelled separetely.
					\item Unconditional logistic regression for the transitional model: outcome is self-reported health status in the 2nd time point.
					\item Values from both time points: physical activity, BMI and smoking were included.
					\item A transition model takes into account both the regression objective and the within-subject correlation.
					\item Proportional hazard models was applied for all-cause mortality.
					\item Changes in lifestyle factors, i.e. physical activity, smoking, BMI, hypertension were defined as 4 categories. 1. remained high risk. 2. changed from low to high risk. 3. changed from high to low risk. 4. remained low risk.
					\item Education, country of birth, and marital status were adjusted.
				\end{itemize}
			\item[Findings] \mbox{}\par
				\begin{itemize}
					\item For the cross-sectional association between lifestyle and health status, physical activity and BMI were independently associated with health. 
					\item Smoking was not independently associated, but significant interaction was found with physical activity based on the cross-secitonal GEE.
					\item Physical activity was found among the strongest factor for health status based on the cross-sectional GEE.
					\item From transitional model, those who stopped PA or remained no PA had about 2 times higher odds for poor health.
					\item From hazard model, those who stopped PA or remained no PA had higher risk of death.
				\end{itemize}
			\item[Strengths] \mbox{}\par
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Nationally representative sample.
					\item Marginal model and transitional model was effective to analyze the change.
				\end{itemize}
			\item[Limitations] \mbox{}\par
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Only 2 time points, which means changes might have happend during 8 years.
					\item Health status and others were based on self-reported.
				\end{itemize}
			\item[Significance]\mbox{}\par
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Identified a cross-sectional associations between smoking, obesity, PA and health status.
					\item Identified the change of lifestyle behaviors were associated with all-cause mortality.
				\end{itemize}
			\item[Conclusion]\mbox{}\par
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Among smoking, PA, and BMI, PA was found to be an important factor to maintain good health and achieving low mortality.
				\end{itemize}
			\item[Takeaways] \mbox{}\par
				\begin{itemize}
					\item[$\clubsuit$] During the 1980s, mortality declined in Sweden as in most Western countries.
					\item[$\clubsuit$] Most parts of the mortality decline was attributed to the decrrese in the rates of CVD and stroke.

	\item 60\% of adult population in the world does not reach the recommended level of physical activity (WHO. The World health report:2002:Reducing the riss, promoting healthy life. Geneva. WHO; 2002. p.248.)
	\item Physical inactivity is the fifth leading risk facto for burden of disease for women in Sweden and the sixth leading risk factor for men (Agardh E, Moradi T, Allebeck P. The contribution of risk factors to the burden of disease in Sweden. A comparison between Swedish and wHO data. Lakartidningen. 2008.)
	\item Exercise is defined as "planned, structured, and repetitive and purposive in the sense that the improvement or maintenance of one or more components of physical fitness is the objective", subcategory of physical activity (Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee. Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee Report, 2008.)
