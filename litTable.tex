	Mason, 2018 \textit{Lancet Public Health} & 
	%%%2.Objectives%%%
	To examine the association between accessibility of fast food (FF) and physical activity (PA) faclities and adults' obesity. & 
	%%%3.Methods%%%
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
		\item Cross-sectional  \item 22 UK biobank  \item 40-69 years old  \item Y: Waist, BMI, fat  \item X: PA 1000m, FF distance \item Z: Basic, deprivation, urbanization, residential density
	\end{itemize} &
	%%%4.Findings%%%
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
		\item PA density was associated with lower adiposity \item FF proximity was asssociated with lower adiposity \item Robust association after stratifed by sex and income  
		\end{itemize} &
	%%%5.Significance%%%
		\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt] \item Recreational facilities were found to be associated rather than urban designs \item Imply the change of facilities might be effective to lower the risk of obesity
		\end{itemize} &
	%%%6.Limitations%%%
		\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt] \item No causality \item No mediator analysis

	%%%1.Reference%%%
	Barrientos, 2017 \textit{Am J Epidemiol} & 
	%%%2.Objectives%%%
	To examine the association between change of healthy food (HF) availablity, walkable environment, and recreational resources measured by subjectively (sub) and objectively (ob) and change of BMI among mid-older adults. &
	%%%3.Methods%%%
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt] \item Longitudinal \item 6 US urban areas \item 45-84 years old \item Y: BMI \item X: HF availability and walkable environment (sub). Density of HF and Rec within 1 mile (ob) \item Z: Basic, residence duration (time-invariant). Marital status, cancer, income (time-varying) 
	\end{itemize} &
	%%%4.Findings%%%
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt] \item Favorable change of both food and pa envrionment was associated with BMI reduction among obese/overweight people 
	\end{itemize} &
	%%%5.Significance%%%
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt] \item First study taking into account for changes in environment measured by both subjectively and objectively against the change of BMI
	\end{itemize} &
	%%%6.Limitations%%%
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt] \item Missing confoundings, ie. deprevation \item No mediation analysis

	%%%1.Reference%%%
	Hirsch, 2014 \textit{Am J Epidemiol} &
	%%%2.Objectives%%%
	To examine the association between change of built envrionment and change of walking for recreation (rec) and transportatio (tran) among mid-older adults. &
	%%%3.Methods%%%
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt] \item Longitudinal \item 6 US urban areas \item 45-84 years old \item Y: Self report walking time for rec and tran \item X: Population density, retail area, residential area, social destinations within 1 mile, distance to bus stop, and street network ratio \item Z: Basic, residence duration (time-invariant). Marital status, employment, income, car-ownership, self-rated health, arthritis (time-varying) 
	\end{itemize} &
	%%%4.Findings%%%
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt] \item Higher residential use and a distance to bus stops were associated with a increase in walking \item Increases in te number of social destinations, walking destinations, and street connectivity were associated with greater increases in wallking for tran \item No changes in built environment measures were associated with leisure walking
	\end{itemize} &
	%%%5.Significance%%%
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt] \item First study taking into account for changes in environment measured by GIS against the change of walking
	\end{itemize} &
	%%%6.Limitations%%%
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt] \item Missing confoundings, ie. deprevation \item No mediation analysis

	Kawakami, 2011 \textit{Int J Com Epi} &
	%%%2.Objectives%%%
	To examine the association between the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) and availability of health promoting and damageing recouses. &
	%%%3.Methods%%%
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt] \item Longitudinal \item Sweden \item 35-80 years old \item Y: CHD diagnosis - age-standardised incidence proportions \item X: Fast food, bars/pubs, PA, healthcare facilities by neighobrhood count, individual buffer count, and distance \item Z: Basic, income, deprivation
	\end{itemize} &
	%%%4.Findings%%%
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt] \item There was a weak association between neighborhood availability and CHD \item There was an unexpected direction associated beween PA and healthcare facilities and CHD
	\end{itemize} &
	%%%5.Significance%%%
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt] \item First study conducted multilevel investigation to examine the longitudinal individual-level association between CHD and neighborhood availability of potentially health-promoting and damaging resources.
	\end{itemize} &
	%%%6.Limitations%%%
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt] \item Missing temporal change of neighborhod envrioment
